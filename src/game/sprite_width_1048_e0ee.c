/* sprite_width_1048_e0ee: candidate for 1048:e0ee (35 bytes).  Verdict: RELOCATABLE.
 * name-source: descriptive
 * size-source: 35, not the census 31. The trailing 4 bytes are the dead second epilogue.
 *
 * `rect_width_1048_d69b` on the member 0x8 bytes into the object -- the address is computed, not loaded,
 * so the member is embedded and not a pointer to one.
 *
 * RENAMED 2026-09-26 from rect_width_at_8_1048_e0ee: the width of the sprite's RECT area at +8 (Sprite_Init's layout); every
 * caller passes a sprite -- g_icon_sprites entries, g_background_tile, a window's logo or tile.

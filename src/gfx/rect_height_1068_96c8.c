/* rect_height_1068_96c8: candidate for 1068:96c8 (32 bytes).  Verdict: EXACT.
 * name-source: descriptive
 * size-source: 32, not the census 28. The trailing 4 bytes are the dead second epilogue
 * the written-out `return` adds (rule 44).
 *
 * The height of a rectangle, bottom minus top -- this segment's copy. One small function compiled into
 * SEVENTEEN modules; both halves are loaded through their own `LES BX`, because `-Od` keeps
 * nothing.
